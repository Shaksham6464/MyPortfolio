# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Steps for the creating this website:

1.Create a Vite + React project
Start a new project using Vite with React as the framework.

2.Install all necessary libraries
Install Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, React Scroll, React Icons, Redux Toolkit, and React Redux.

3.Configure Tailwind CSS
Set up the Tailwind configuration and link it to your projectâ€™s CSS file.

4.Set up the folder structure
Organize folders for components, sections (About, Projects, etc.), assets, Redux features, and store.

5.Develop the layout and sections
Build individual sections for About, Projects, Experience, Contact, etc., and lay them out on the main page.

6.Style your components using Tailwind CSS
Make your site fully responsive and visually appealing using Tailwind utility classes.

7.Add animations with Framer Motion
Apply smooth animations to sections, buttons, and transitions for better UX.

8.Implement smooth scroll navigation
Use React Scroll to create a smooth scrolling navbar that links to different sections.

9.Manage state with Redux Toolkit
Set up a Redux store and use slices to handle any global state (like theme toggles, modal status, etc.).

10.Test and deploy the website
Test responsiveness, fix bugs, and deploy your portfolio using GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
